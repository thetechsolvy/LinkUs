**Project Overview**:  
FaceDash is an interactive web application where users can upload images, rate them, and leave comments. The platform aims to create an engaging user experience while fostering community interaction.

**User Onboarding**:  
1. Upon visiting the site for the first time, users are welcomed with a pop-up modal asking them to enter their name. This name will be stored for future interactions.
2. Once the user enters their name, the content of the site becomes accessible, enhancing personalization.

**Image Upload Functionality**:  
1. Users should be able to upload images with an accompanying name for the image.
2. An animation should be displayed during the upload process to inform users of the upload status.
3. After a successful upload, an alert should notify users of the success.

**Image Display**:  
1. Uploaded images will be presented in a visually appealing profile card format that includes:
   - The uploaded image
   - The name of the uploader
   - An average rating displayed with star icons
   - A section for comments, with each comment indicating the name of the commenter

**Rating and Commenting System**:  
1. Users can rate each image on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, but they can only rate an image once.
2. Ratings should be displayed in a dropdown menu format, listing the rater's name alongside their rating.
3. Users should be able to leave comments on images, which will also be displayed in a dropdown menu format, showing the commenter's name.

**Leaderboard**:  
1. A leaderboard section should showcase the top 10 rated images, allowing users to see which images are most popular.
2. The leaderboard should be dynamically updated based on the ratings.

**Visual Design and User Experience**:  
1. The overall design of the site should be visually appealing, incorporating modern UI/UX principles to enhance user interaction.
2. The site should be responsive, ensuring that it functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. Alerts should be used effectively to inform users about their actions (e.g., uploads, ratings, comments).

**Global Interaction**:  
1. All ratings and comments should be publicly visible to all users, fostering community engagement.
2. The system should handle concurrent updates effectively, ensuring that users see the latest data without having to refresh the page.

**Overall Goal**:  
To create a seamless, engaging, and interactive experience for users to share their images, express their opinions through ratings and comments, and enjoy the communal aspects of the platform.
